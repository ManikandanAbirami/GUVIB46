MySQL - Most popular open-source DataBase Management System(DBMS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

MySQL Basics:
-------------

Data: It can be facts releated to any object in consideration.

DataBase: Systematic collection of Data. It makes data management easy.

Types of DataBases:
-------------------

1. Distributed DataBases
2. Releational DataBases(Oracle, Sybase, MySQL, MS SQL Server...) RDBMS - 
                                It defines database relationships in the form of tables
3. Object-oriented DataBases
4. Centralized Database
5. Open-source DataBases
6. Cloud DataBases
7. Data warehouses
8. NoSQL DataBases(MongoDB) - Very efficient in analyzing large-size unstructured data
9. Graph DataBases
10.OLTP DataBases
11.Personal DataBases
12.Multimodal DataBases
13.Document/JSON DataBases
14.Hierarchical
15.Network DBMS

DataBase Components:
--------------------

1. Hardware
2. Software
3. Data
4. Procedure - set of instructions
5. DataBase Access Language - Some specific commands 

DataBase Management System(DBMS):
---------------------------------

--> Is a collection of programs that enable its users to access databases,
    manipulate data, report, and represent data.

Advantages:

1. Store and retrieve data
2. Offers security
3. Reduced Application Development Time

Disadvantages:

1. Cost of Hardware and Software
2. Training is required for sure to use DBMS
3. If not used carefully we lose some data.

SQL - Structured Query Language
-------------------------------

SELECT * FROM students WHERE Age > 11

SQL is used for:
----------------

1. It helps users to access data in the RDBMS system.
2. It helps you to describe data.
3. It helps to define and manipulate data.
4. With the help of SQL, we can create and drop databases and tables.

Types of SQL Statements/Commands:
--------------------------------

1. Data Definition Language(DDL) ***** DDL - CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE and DROP
2. Data Manipulation Language(DML) ***** DML - INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
3. Data Control Language(DCL) **
4. Transaction Control Language(TCL) **
5. Data Query Language(DQL) ***


INSERT INTO TABLE,
CREATE TABLE,
SELET,
WHERE,
ALTER,
GROUP BY,
DELETE,
TRUNCATE,
DROP,
USE,
ORDER BY,
UPDATE,
DISTINCT

GROUP BY vs DISTINCT : GROUP BY groups ROWS, where as DISTINCT is just used to get values

Primary key:- 

1. A primary key cannot be NULL
2. A primary key value must be UNIQUE
3. The primary key values should rarely be changed
4. The primary key must be given a value when a new record is inserted.

Composite Key:-

1. A composite key is a primary key composed of multiple columns used to 
   identify a record uniquely.

Normalization:

1. It is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy(state of being not used)
2. Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables.

Database Normal Forms:

--> 1NF(First Normal Form)
--> 2NF
--> 3NF
--> BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
--> 4NF
--> 5NF
--> 6NF

1NF:

1. Each table cell should contain a single value.
2. Each record needs to be unique.

2NF:

1. Be in 1NF
2. Foreign key

Foreign key:

1. Foreign key references the primary key of another table. It helps connect your tables.
2. A foreign key can have a different name from its primary key.
3. It ensures rows in one table have corresponding rows in another table.
4. They do not have to be unique.
4. foreign key can be null.

3NF:

1. Rule 1 - be in 2NF
2. no functional dependencies

BCNF(Boyce-Codd Normal Form):

1. 3.5 Normal Form
2. Slightly stronger version of 3NF.
3. Extension of 3NF

4NF:

1. Rule 1 - be in 3NF(1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
2. Independent and multivalued data
3. It eliminates harmful redundancy

5NF:

1. Rule 1 - be in 4NF
2. It is deigned to remove redundancy effectively

6NF:

1. It is not standardized


JOINS:

1. Joins help us to reteieve data from two or more tables

Types:

1. Inner Join
2. Outer Join - Left outer join & Right Outer join
3. Cross Join
4. SELF Join

INNER JOIN:
Is the most common form of JOIN and it is widely used.

LEFT OUTER JOIN:
This typ of join would fetch all the rows(including NULL values) from the table
which is on the left side.
