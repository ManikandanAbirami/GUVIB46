MongoDB Basics (Written in c++):

1. Non-relational database
2. Scale-out architecture - to handle load it will add extra nodes.
3. MongoDB stores data as JSON documents - simple for delvelopers to learn and use.
4. A record in MongoDB is a document - composed of key value pair similar to JSON objs.
    ex:
    {
      title: "Good Morning",
      body: "Hi all, how you doiny, today??",
      category: "Wishes",
      likes: "200",
      tags: ["morning", "friends"],
      date: Date(),
      comments: [
        {
          user: "Manikandan A",
          message: "Same to you",
          dateCreated: new Date(2023, 20, 2, 15),
          like: 4
        },
        {
          user: "John",
          message: ":) :) :) ",
          dateCreated: new Date(2023, 20, 12, 15),
          like: 6
        },
      ]
    }
5. Database - SCHEMA/DATABASE
6. Table - COLLECTION
7. Column - FIELD
8. Rows - DOCUMENT
9. Advantages:
   --> Schema less : One collection holds different documents
   --> Single object
   --> No complex joins
   --> Uses internal memory   
10.Why MongoDB?
   --> Fast in-place updates
   --> Document oriented storage
   --> Replication and high availability(discuss later point)
11.Where to use MongoDB?
   --> Big Data
   --> User Data Management
   --> Content Management and Delivery    
   --> Mobile and Social Infrastructure 

Basic commands, Insert, Query commands, update, delete.
